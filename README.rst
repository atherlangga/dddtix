DDDtix
======

DDDtix is an example of **technical** implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). I emphasize "technical" because DDD is a lot more than technical methodologies. Eric Evans, the author of the book, even mention that the core of DDD is its usage of language (known as Ubiquitious Language in DDD terminology).

However, because of its abstractness, many people question how its technical implementation looks like. This project tries to give an example.


The Domain
==========

The domain for this example project is Movie Theater, which has needs to manage its movie listing and online ticketing.

Please be aware, though, that the domain is totally made up.


Project Structure
=================

DDD emphasize on iterative improvement, so this project trying to keep the same spirit. Each directory contains each iteration. The iteration is ordered and also numbered starting from 1. Each directory also contains explanation and rationale for each iteration.
