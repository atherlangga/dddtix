DDDtix
======

DDDtix is an example of **technical** implementation of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). I emphasize on "technical" because DDD is a lot more than technical methodologies. Eric Evans, the author of the book, even mentions that the core of DDD is its usage of language (also known as **Ubiquitious Language** in DDD terminology).

However, because of its abstractness, many people question how its technical implementation looks like. This project tries to give an example.


The Domain
==========

The domain for this example project is a Movie Theater, at which its owner wants to adapt his growing business to a more connected world. So, he asked a software developer to build a software to manage this Movie Theater.

Please be aware, though, that the domain is totally made up.


Project Structure
=================

DDD emphasizes on continuous and iterative improvement and this project trying to keep the same spirit. So, the project structure is formed based on that.

Each directory contains each development iteration. The iteration is ordered and also numbered starting from 1. Each iteration should also contains explanation and rationale.


Requirements
============

Basic knowledge of DDD is required. If you don't know what ``Entity`` object, ``Value Object``, or ``Repository`` means, perhaps this isn't for you.
